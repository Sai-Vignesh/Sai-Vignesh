Got it! If your university already has a standardized PDF format for the photo release form and you want to automate filling in attendee information (like their name) into that existing form, you can use a Python library like `PyPDF2` or `pdfrw` to manipulate the existing PDF.

Here’s how you can automate this process using the `pdfrw` library to fill in the fields of an existing PDF.

### Steps:
1. **Get the existing PDF form**: Ensure you have the standard photo release form as a fillable PDF, with form fields (like `Name`, `Signature`, etc.).
2. **Read and fill the form fields**: Use `pdfrw` to read the form and fill in the fields with the attendee's information (like their name).
3. **Save a new PDF for each attendee**: Create a new filled-in PDF for each attendee.

### Step 1: Install the `pdfrw` Library

To work with PDFs in Python, you can use the `pdfrw` library. Install it via pip:

```bash
pip install pdfrw
```

### Step 2: Python Code for Filling Form Fields

Here’s a script that reads the existing PDF template, fills in attendee information, and outputs a new PDF for each person:

```python
import pandas as pd
from pdfrw import PdfReader, PdfWriter

# Read attendee data from a CSV file (you can customize this for your needs)
attendees_df = pd.read_csv('attendees.csv')  # Assume CSV with columns 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Email'

# Path to the existing PDF form (standard template)
template_pdf_path = 'photo_release_form_template.pdf'

# Function to fill form fields
def fill_pdf(input_pdf_path, output_pdf_path, attendee_name):
    # Read the template PDF
    template_pdf = PdfReader(input_pdf_path)
    
    # Fill in the form fields
    for page in template_pdf.pages:
        for annotation in page['/Annots']:
            field = annotation.getObject()
            field_name = field['/T']
            
            # Assuming the field name for attendee name is 'Name' (adjust this if needed)
            if field_name == 'Name':  # Change 'Name' if the field in the template has a different name
                field.update({
                    pdfrw.PdfName('/V'): pdfrw.PdfString(attendee_name)
                })
                
    # Write the updated form to a new file
    writer = PdfWriter()
    writer.addpage(template_pdf.pages[0])  # Add the modified page
    writer.write(output_pdf_path)

# Iterate over each attendee and create a personalized PDF
for index, row in attendees_df.iterrows():
    # Construct the attendee's full name
    attendee_name = f"{row['FirstName']} {row['LastName']}"
    
    # Define the output PDF path for this attendee
    output_pdf_path = f"photo_release_{row['FirstName']}_{row['LastName']}.pdf"
    
    # Fill the template with the attendee's data and generate the new PDF
    fill_pdf(template_pdf_path, output_pdf_path, attendee_name)

print("Photo release forms generated for all attendees.")
```

### Explanation:

1. **CSV Input**: The `attendees.csv` file should contain a list of attendees. You can have columns like `FirstName`, `LastName`, and `Email`.

    Example `attendees.csv`:
    ```csv
    FirstName,LastName,Email
    John,Doe,john.doe@example.com
    Jane,Smith,jane.smith@example.com
    ```

2. **Template PDF**: The `photo_release_form_template.pdf` is the existing form that already contains the required fields (e.g., for `Name`). The field names should match what’s in your template (e.g., `Name`, `Date`, `Signature`).

3. **Filling Fields**: The function `fill_pdf()` looks for fields in the PDF (based on their names) and fills them with the corresponding attendee data. You’ll need to adjust the field names in the code (like `Name`) based on the actual field names in your template.

4. **Output**: For each attendee, a new PDF will be generated with their name filled in the appropriate field.

### How to Identify the Field Names

To ensure you fill the correct fields, you’ll need to know the exact names of the fields in your template. You can inspect a PDF's form fields using a tool like Adobe Acrobat Reader or even programmatically by reading the annotations of the PDF. Here's how you can inspect the form fields in the PDF using `pdfrw`:

```python
from pdfrw import PdfReader

# Read the template PDF to inspect its form fields
template_pdf = PdfReader('photo_release_form_template.pdf')

for page in template_pdf.pages:
    for annotation in page['/Annots']:
        field = annotation.getObject()
        print(field['/T'])  # This prints the field name
```

This will print the names of the fields in your PDF form (e.g., `Name`, `Signature`, etc.). Use these field names in your script to ensure you're filling in the right fields.

### Step 3: Run the Script

Once the script is ready, you can run it, and it will create a personalized PDF for each attendee.

### Notes:
- **Field Names**: Be sure the field names in the code (like `'Name'`) match exactly with the field names in your PDF form.
- **Signature Field**: If you want to add more fields like `Date` or `Signature`, you can expand the `fill_pdf()` function to handle additional fields.
- **Adjust Layout**: You can also adjust the position and size of the text you’re inserting if your form is more complex (e.g., if fields have different positions).
